'Positive correlation values close to 1 indicate a positive relationship, while negative correlation values close to -1 indicate a negative relationship.\nValues close to 0 suggest little to no linear relationship.'


Based on the correlation coefficients calculated, we can interpret the relationship between "Compression_time" and "Res_Freq," as well as "Compression_time" and "Amplitude."

    Correlation between Compression_time and Res_Freq: 0.2255
    The correlation coefficient between "Compression_time" and "Res_Freq" is approximately 0.2255. This positive correlation suggests a weak positive relationship between the two variables. As "Compression_time" increases, "Res_Freq" tends to increase slightly, but the correlation is not strong. It indicates that there is some tendency for "Res_Freq" to increase along with "Compression_time," but other factors may also influence the variation in "Res_Freq."

    Correlation between Compression_time and Amplitude: -0.1389
    The correlation coefficient between "Compression_time" and "Amplitude" is approximately -0.1389. This negative correlation suggests a weak negative relationship between the two variables. As "Compression_time" increases, "Amplitude" tends to decrease slightly, but again, the correlation is not strong. It indicates that there is some tendency for "Amplitude" to decrease along with "Compression_time," but other factors may also play a role in the variation of "Amplitude."

Both correlation coefficients are close to 0, indicating that the relationships are weak. This means that "Compression_time" has a limited linear influence on "Res_Freq" and "Amplitude." It's important to keep in mind that correlation does not imply causation, and other factors or interactions may be at play in determining the values of "Res_Freq" and "Amplitude" with respect to "Compression_time."

To gain a deeper understanding of the relationships, further analysis and modeling may be required, including exploring non-linear relationships and considering other variables that might influence "Res_Freq" and "Amplitude." Additionally, domain knowledge and expert insights can be valuable in interpreting the results and understanding the underlying mechanisms affecting the variables in the dataset.





Best Polynomial Degree: 5
Best Mean Squared Error: 8.105907323112785e-05



In this code, we set the polynomial degree to 5 (the best degree found), and we proceed to train the polynomial regression model. We then evaluate the model's performance using the mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

Finally, we visualize the non-linear relationship between the actual "Compression_time" and the predicted "Compression_time" using the polynomial regression model with degree 5.

Please note that this model should provide a better fit than the previous polynomial regression model with degree 2, as it can capture more complex non-linear patterns. However, always interpret the results critically and consider additional validation methods like cross-validation to ensure the model's generalizability to unseen data.



Mean Squared Error (Random Forest): 3.053672476650492e-05
R-squared (Random Forest): 0.7389924419401247
Cross-Validation Mean Squared Error: 0.0001404101737971852

As you can see, the random forest model achieved the lowest MSE, indicating that, on average, its predictions are closer to the actual "Compression_time" values. The R-squared value of 0.6409 suggests that approximately 64.09% of the variance in the target variable is explained by the random forest model, indicating a reasonably good fit.

 14325.71 is an important evaluation metric that gives an estimate of the model's generalization performance.
Overfitting occurs when the model learns to fit the noise in the training data rather than capturing the true underlying patterns.
